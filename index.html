          <h2 class="content-heading">GURA GARW</h2>
          <p class="content-description">HOLOLIVE EN</p>
          <p class="text-theband gura-garw">
            Gura is friendly and readily likeable, and often amuses her viewers
            with foolish antics. She has no sense of direction, often misspells
            and mispronounces words, has trouble remembering her own age, and
            consistently fails to solve basic math problems, leading viewers to
            affectionately call her a "dum shark". Memorably, one viewer
            declared that "Gura has a heart of gold and a head of bone." She can
            also be lazy at times. She often forgets about perishable items
            until they start to rot, and eats baby food "because you don't have
            to cook it... [or] chew on it." However, despite her poor math and
            spelling skills, Gura is quick-witted, clever, and has vast
            knowledge of Shark Facts. When questioned on why she was not "boing
            boing," she excused it by claiming that she was "hydrodynamic." Her
            skill with fast-paced rhythm games is exceptional, and she is highly
            ambitious. She also occasionally makes lewd jokes, and is familiar
            with modern meme culture, which she references often.
          </p>
          <p class="text-theband mori-calliope">
            Calliope is equally excited by both rapping and "reaping." Her
            favorite weapons include her scythe (nicknamed "Ricky") and the
            flail, a medieval weapon made from a spiked metal ball on a chain.
            Calliope is noted for having one of the most lowest pitched voice in
            hololive, even more so than likes of Nekomata Okayu, Tokoyami Towa
            and A-chan. Although fluent in English, Calliope often fails to
            understand current modes of speech, such as the use of contractions
            or modern slang. She is easily flustered by romance, leading some to
            call her the "tsundereaper." When not on camera, however, she is
            described as air-headed and hopelessly forgetful. Kiara has
            mentioned that she frequently misplaces things despite leaving them
            in an obvious place, like leaving her cellphone in her jacket. She
            also works exceptionally hard, perhaps too much so.
          </p>
          <p class="text-theband takanashi-kiara">
            Kiara is enthusiastic and friendly, and is open with her feelings.
            She cares strongly for her friends and family, and misses them a
            great deal while she is abroad. Although energetic and sometimes
            chaotic in nature, and eager to collab with other members, she is
            secretly quite shy. She is sometimes bird-brained, being forgetful
            or having a short attention span. She prefers video games with fixed
            goals, such as RPGs, rather than open-world games like Minecraft. On
            a graph ranking members in purity and intelligence, Kiara was rated
            "bottom left"â€”maximum lewd and foolish, much to her bemusement.
            However, she often surprises viewers with moments of gentleness,
            compassion, and insightful wisdom. Watson Amelia, in her debut
            stream, described Kiara as having a "positive attitude and lovely
            voice." Mori Calliope described her as a hard worker and an
            incredible singer with a great personality, and praised her fluency
            with Japanese.[7] Kiara has a particular fondness for Mori Calliope.
            Kiara, a phoenix who has been continuously reborn, always meets
            Calliope each time she dies. However, it is not within Calliope's
            power to keep a phoenix in the Underworld.
          </p>
          <p class="text-theband watson-amelia">
            Amelia is a rather eccentric girl who is often seen mingling or
            teasing her fellow holoMyth members. She is usually kind,
            supportive, and sweet as shown when she frequently watches her
            fellow members' streams and often willingly helps Gura in Minecraft.
            However Amelia also likes to joke around with the other members and
            sometimes even doing lewd remarks such as naming one of her mines in
            Minecraft "Gura's Backdoor." She also harbors another side of her
            personality that is often referred by her fans as "Gremlin Mode".
            She can be greedy, prideful, and unsportsmanlike in competitive
            online games such as, Apex Legends, and Valorant. For these reasons,
            fans often refer to her as a "True Gamer." Amelia has a special
            voice that she uses when she is in Gremlin Mode, which sounds like a
            cross between a high-pitched wheeze, reptilian screech, and the
            final breath of a dying squeaky toy. She is not above trolling and
            calling out her chat if the opportunity arises, such as when she
            trolled her viewers in one of her Minecraft streams by adjusting her
            shader's brightness very darkly and innocently claiming that she
            fixed the shaders for them. Despite these circumstances, she tries
            her best to moderate her gremlin-like behavior, to varying degrees
            of success. Possibly her best-known joke is "ground pounding your
            mom," which she said once during a Super Mario Odyssey playthrough
            and has since become almost synonymous with her character. She
            frequently makes similar lewd remarks seemingly out of nowhere. It
            might seem that Amelia has no filter, but that isn't entirely
            accurate. She does have a filter, but most of the outrageous things
            that are caught in her filter end up being said out loud regardless.
            Overall, her balanced chemistry of sweetness and saltiness makes her
            very lovable as noted by her fans.
          </p>
          <p class="text-theband ninomae-ina'nis">
            Despite her Lovecraftian-themed appearance, Ina is gentle, peaceful
            and down-to-earth. She is considerate and kind; Takanashi Kiara
            relates that when she is down, Ina is always the first to message
            her. In complete contrast to the salty gremlin Amelia, Ina has
            near-infinite patience and is widely considered the most
            well-behaved member of her generation. Ina is infamous for her use
            of puns and dry delivery of "dad jokes."
